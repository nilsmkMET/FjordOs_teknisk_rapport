  \caption{\small The topography and irregular coastline of the Oslofjord and its location in Southern Norway. The right-hand grey scale bar indicates depth in meters. The blue arrow points to the location of the fjord's main sill (the {\DR} sill as enlarged in Figure \ref{fig:droebak_sill}) which is only $\sim$ 20 m deep. Note also the $\sim$ 400 m deep basin extending from the Skagerrak towards the Hvaler Archipelago in the southeast, the so-called Hvalerdjupet. }
