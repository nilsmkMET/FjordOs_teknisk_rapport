  \caption{\small Illustrated is the impact of grid resolution on how the Oslofjord is portrayed. Upper two panels show what the fjord looks like utilizing respectively a 20 km grid (left) and 4 km grid (right). Bottom panel show the same for utilizing a 800 m grid to represent the fjord. As revealed the smaller the grid size (higher grid resolution) the better the coastline geometry is represented. }
